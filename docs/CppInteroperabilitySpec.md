# PROVISIONAL C++ Interoperability Specification

This document condenses the many options discussed in the [C++ Interoperability
Manifesto][manifesto] into a single set of choices, with much less narrative.
It is not official in any way, but it provides one possible coherent view of
what C++ interoperability will look like.

## Goals and Tradeoffs

These are not the goals from the corresponding section of the
[manifesto][manifesto]; instead, they are the criteria by which we've chosen
what to include in this provisional specification.

- **API Accessibility**: all C++ APIs should be usable from Swift, and all Swift
  APIs usable from C++, without manual annotation or wrapping.
- The following take precedence over safety and ergonomics:
  - API Accessibility.
  - Avoiding any performance penalties at the API boundary.
- The ability to easily make an imported C++ API safe and ergonomic in Swift
  with manual intervention (annotation, wrapping, etc.) is a goal.
- Using a C++ API from Swift should not introduce any new, Swift-specific
  “gotchas,” and vice-versa.
  
## Access to entities across langauges

Keeping all APIs accessible means being able to uniquely name, in each language,
every distinct entity that can be named in the other language.  For example,
there must be a way distinguish `T*` from `T&` in Swift.

## Escaped Names

In Swift, the “escaped name” `@cplusplus(`*cpp-name*`)` refers to the C++ entity
identified by *cpp-name* in C++.  In C++, the escaped name
`@swift(`*swift-name*`)` refers to the Swift entity identified by *swift-name*
in Swift.

## Equivalences

Many entities are mapped to equivalent names in the other language. For example,
in Swift

- `@cplusplus(int)` is equivalent to `Int`.
- `@cplusplus(std::uncaught_exception)` is equivalent to `std.uncaught_exception`.
- `@cplusplus(T*)` is equivalent to `UnsafeMutablePointer<U>` when
  `@cplusplus(T)` is equivalent to `U`.

We'll write `@cplusplus(X) == Y` to mean `@cplusplus(X)` and `Y` are equivalent
in Swift.

## Similar Types

Some types without an exact equivalent across languages will nonetheless have a
close correspondence with a type in the other language.  For example, `T&` in
C++, where `T` is not *cv-qualified*, corresponds closely to
`UnsafeMutablePointer<U>` in Swift where `U == @cplusplus(T)`.  Similar types
should implicitly convert:

```swift
func f0(p: UnsafeMutablePointer<Int>, g: @cplusplus(int&(*)(int&))) 
  -> UnsafeMutablePointer<Int>
{
  g(p) // bidirectional implicit conversion
}
```

and when there is a unique similar type but no exact equivalent, should be
implicitly deduced in deduced contexts.  For example, if there is no Swift
equivalent for `T&` (e.g. `UnsafeMutableCPlusPlusReference<U>`), we would make
`UnsafeMutablePointer<U>` a unique similar type where `U == @cplusplus(T)`.
Then this function should compile without error:

```swift
func f(g: @cplusplus(int&(*)())) -> UnsafeMutablePointer<Int> {
  let p = g() // p deduced as UnsafeMutablePointer<Int>
  return p
}
```

We'll write `@cplusplus(T) ~ U` or `@cplusplus(T) ~= U` to mean that
`@cplusplus(T)` and `U` are similar or uniquely similar, respectively, in
Swift.

## Functions

There are various ways to annotate C++ and Swift functions to control how they
are exposed to the other language, specifics to be covered elsewhere in this
document.

#### Non-const pointer and reference parameters to C++ functions

Unless otherwise-annotated, pointer and reference to non-const `T` are exposed
to Swift as `UnsafeMutablePointer<T>` and `UnsafeMutableReference<T>`, where the
latter is defined as:

```swift
@propertyWrapper
struct UnsafeMutableReference<T> {
  public let address: UnsafeMutablePointer<T>
  var projectedValue: Self { self }
  init(_ address: UnsafeMutablePointer<T>) {
    self.address = address
  }
  var wrappedValue: T {
    get { address.pointee }
    nonmutating _modify { yield &address.pointee }
    nonmutating set { address.pointee = newValue }
  }
}
```

<details><summary>Rationale</summary>
  
For pointers, the precedent is already set by existing C interop.

Precedent aside, the following reasoning applies:

- in **call context**, Swift already suppors `inout` *syntax* (or implicit
  conversion from `inout`, if you like) for forming mutable pointer arguments,
  so the calling code works as-if the parameter had `inout` type.  Presenting
  the signature of such a C++ function as taking an `inout` parameter would
  simplify the user's view of the C++ API a bit, but also make the potential
  unsafety less explicit.

- in **implementation context**, a pointer to non-`const` parameter cannot be
  exposed as into `inout` because nothing on the C++ (calling) side upholds the
  exclusivity guarantees the compiler counts on for `inout` parameters.

Semantically, C++ lvalue references are exactly like C++ pointers except for
non-reseatability, implicit dereferencing, and the lack of pointer arithmetic.
The same rationales apply to choices about mapping.  A different mapping, to use
`inout` in call context, is the most we could hope for, but as noted above
provides only marginal benefits and makes the mapping asymmetric.

Mapping any two C++ types (e.g. `T*` and `T&`) to the same Swift type is a
non-starter per our goals, as it would make some C++ APIs inaccessible.  You
need to be able to access every template specialization and/or overload.

An [extension to property wrappers
](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-2-extend-property-wrappers-to-function-and-closure-parameters)
that seems likely to be accepted, and likely further directions, seem as though
they'll make `UnsafeMutableReference<T>` increasingly ergonomic, tipping the
balance in favor of creating this equivalent type instead of just mapping to
`@cplusplus(T&)`.

#### Const reference parameters

Unless otherwise-annotated, pointer and reference to const `T` are exposed
to Swift as `UnsafePointer<T>` and `UnsafeReference<T>`, where the
latter is defined as:

```swift
@propertyWrapper
struct UnsafeReference<T> {
  public let address: UnsafePointer<T>
  var projectedValue: Self { self }
  init(_ address: UnsafePointer<T>) {
    self.address = address
  }
  var wrappedValue: T {
    get { address.pointee }
  }
}
```

The rationales mirror those in the previous section, with `shared` (from the
ownership manifesto) playing the role of `inout`.
