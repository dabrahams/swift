/// A single extended grapheme cluster that approximates a user-perceived
/// character.
///
/// The `Character` type represents a character made up of one or more Unicode
/// scalar values, grouped by a Unicode boundary algorithm. Generally, a
/// `Character` instance matches what the reader of a string will perceive as
/// a single character. Strings are collections of `Character` instances, so
/// the number of visible characters is generally the most natural way to
/// count the length of a string.
///
///     let greeting = "Hello! üê•"
///     print("Length: \(greeting.count)")
///     // Prints "Length: 8"
///
/// Because each character in a string can be made up of one or more Unicode
/// code points, the number of characters in a string may not match the length
/// of the Unicode code point representation or the length of the string in a
/// particular binary representation.
///
///     print("Unicode code point count: \(greeting.unicodeScalars.count)")
///     // Prints "Unicode code point count: 15"
///
///     print("UTF-8 representation count: \(greeting.utf8.count)")
///     // Prints "UTF-8 representation count: 18"
///
/// Every `Character` instance is composed of one or more Unicode code points
/// that are grouped together as an *extended grapheme cluster*. The way these
/// code points are grouped is defined by a canonical, localized, or otherwise
/// tailored Unicode segmentation algorithm.
///
/// For example, a country's Unicode flag character is made up of two regional
/// indicator code points that correspond to that country's ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
/// code. The alpha-2 code for The United States is "US", so its flag
/// character is made up of the Unicode code points `"\u{1F1FA}"` (REGIONAL
/// INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER U) and `"\u{1F1F8}"` (REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL
/// LETTER S). When placed next to each other in a Swift string literal, these
/// two code points are combined into a single grapheme cluster, represented
/// by a `Character` instance in Swift.
///
///     let usFlag: Character = "\u{1F1FA}\u{1F1F8}"
///     print(usFlag)
///     // Prints "üá∫üá∏"
///
/// For more information about the Unicode terms used in this discussion, see
/// the [Unicode.org glossary][glossary]. In particular, this discussion
/// mentions [extended grapheme clusters][clusters] and [Unicode scalar
/// values][scalars].
